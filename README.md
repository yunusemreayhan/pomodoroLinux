# Pomodoro Linux

A full-featured multi-user Pomodoro timer for Linux with a Rust HTTP backend, Tauri v2 GUI, hierarchical task management, sprint planning, estimation rooms, and time tracking. Packaged as a single `.deb`.

## Features

### Timer
- Pomodoro work/break cycles with configurable durations
- Auto-start breaks and work sessions
- Desktop notifications on session completion
- Daily goal tracking

### Hierarchical Task Management
- Unlimited nesting (projects → epics → stories → subtasks)
- Inline create, edit, delete with cascade
- Double-click to rename task titles
- Status tracking: backlog → in_progress → completed
- Priority (1-5), estimated pomodoros, estimated hours, story points
- Task assignees (many-to-many)
- Comments on tasks
- Time reports with auto-assignment
- Recursive rollup of hours, points, and session time
- Export tasks as Markdown, JSON, or XML

### File Attachments
- Upload files to tasks (10MB max per file)
- Download and delete attachments
- Filename sanitization (path traversal protection)

### Labels, Dependencies & Recurrence
- Create/manage labels with custom colors
- Task dependencies (depends-on relationships)
- Recurring tasks (daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly)

### Task Templates
- Save task configurations as reusable templates
- Create/list/delete via API

### Internationalization (i18n)
- Zustand-based locale store with 90+ typed string keys
- English locale included, extensible to any language
- Locale selector in Settings

### Sprint Management
- Create sprints with name, project, goal, and date range
- Sprint lifecycle: planning → active → completed
- **Board tab**: Kanban columns (Todo / In Progress / Done) with click-to-change-status
- **Backlog tab**: Add/remove tasks using the full hierarchical task tree
- **Burndown tab**: SVG line chart with ideal vs actual remaining (toggle points/hours/tasks)
- **Summary tab**: Stats cards, velocity, per-user progress bars
- Auto-snapshot: hourly background task captures burndown data for active sprints
- Sprint badges on all task views (green = active sprint, pale green = past sprint)

### Burn Log (Unified Time & Point Tracking)
- Single source of truth for all burned time and points
- Three sources: `manual` (sprint burns), `timer` (auto-logged on pomodoro completion), `time_report` (ad-hoc hour logging)
- Sprint-scoped burns (optional sprint_id) or task-level burns
- Timer auto-logs hours (duration/3600) with session_id reference on pomodoro completion
- Soft-delete (cancel) with full audit trail — who cancelled what
- Per-user per-day summary view
- Per-task burn totals computed from burn_log
- Cancelled entries remain visible with strikethrough
- `time_reports` table eliminated — replaced by burn_log with source="time_report"

### Estimation Rooms (Planning Poker)
- Create rooms with points or hours estimation
- Real-time voting with card deck (Fibonacci for points, linear for hours)
- 3-2-1 countdown reveal animation
- Quick-accept, custom value accept, re-vote
- Auto-advance to next unestimated task after accept
- Admin inline edit task title/description from voting screen
- Room roles: admin/voter with promote/demote/kick
- Vote history with per-user breakdown

### Multi-User
- JWT authentication (bcrypt + 7-day tokens)
- First registered user becomes root (seed: root/root)
- Root users can manage all users and override ownership
- Everyone sees all data; ownership controls edit/delete
- Profile management (change username/password)
- Admin panel for user role management

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Rust + axum HTTP server on port 9090
- **Frontend**: Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4
- **Database**: SQLite with foreign key constraints
- **Auth**: JWT with user_id-based identity (usernames are changeable)
- **API**: OpenAPI/Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui/`
- **State**: Zustand store with Tauri invoke → reqwest bridge

## Database Schema (17 tables)

All user references use `user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)` — usernames are resolved via JOINs. This means usernames can be changed without breaking any foreign key relationships.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | id, username (unique, changeable), password_hash, role, created_at |
| `tasks` | Hierarchical tasks with user_id FK, parent_id self-ref, status, estimates |
| `sessions` | Pomodoro timer sessions with user_id FK |
| `comments` | Comments on tasks with user_id FK |
| `task_assignees` | Many-to-many task↔user with user_id FK |
| `rooms` | Estimation rooms with creator_id FK |
| `room_members` | Room membership with user_id FK and role |
| `room_votes` | Votes with user_id FK, unique per room+task+user |
| `sprints` | Sprint metadata with created_by_id FK |
| `sprint_tasks` | Sprint↔task mapping with added_by_id FK |
| `sprint_daily_stats` | Burndown snapshots per sprint per day |
| `sprint_root_tasks` | Root task scoping for sprints |
| `burn_log` | Unified burn tracking: manual entries, timer completions, time reports |
| `user_configs` | Per-user timer configuration overrides |
| `teams` | Team definitions with name |
| `team_members` | Team↔user membership with roles |
| `team_root_tasks` | Root task scoping for teams |
| `epic_groups` | Epic group definitions for cross-sprint tracking |
| `epic_group_tasks` | Epic group↔task mapping |
| `epic_snapshots` | Daily burndown snapshots for epic groups |

## Installation

```bash
# Build
cd gui && cargo tauri build --bundles deb

# Install
sudo dpkg -i target/release/bundle/deb/Pomodoro_0.1.0_amd64.deb

# The daemon auto-starts via systemd user service
systemctl --user status pomodoro.service

# Access Swagger UI
open http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui/
```

## Testing

### ⚠️ Run tests before pushing

```bash
# 1. Unit/integration tests (fast, no GUI needed)
cargo test -p pomodoro-daemon

# 2. E2E GUI tests (requires built binaries + display)
./e2etests/run_e2e.sh
```

Both must pass before pushing to main.

### Unit & Integration Tests

40 integration tests run automatically before every build (configured in `tauri.conf.json`):

```bash
cargo test -p pomodoro-daemon
```

Tests use in-memory SQLite — no disk I/O, fully isolated, no port conflicts.

### E2E GUI Tests

659 end-to-end tests across 31 files drive the real Tauri GUI via WebDriver against an isolated daemon. 100% API endpoint coverage (154/154 endpoints tested).

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
./e2etests/run_e2e.sh

# Run a specific test file
./e2etests/run_e2e.sh test_flows.py

# Run a specific test class
./e2etests/run_e2e.sh test_flows.py::TestLogin
```

**Coverage areas:**
- GUI flows: login, registration, timer, task detail, sprint board, settings, theme, sidebar navigation
- API exhaustive: every endpoint, every status transition, every config field
- Edge cases: unicode/emoji, 10K-char strings, SQL/HTML injection, boundary values
- Multi-user: permissions, privilege escalation, cross-user scenarios
- Stress: 500 concurrent task creates, 200 rapid requests
- Regressions: stale token auth, React 19 input filling, Xvfb display isolation

**Writing new tests:** See [`e2etests/CHEATSHEET.md`](e2etests/CHEATSHEET.md) for copy-paste patterns and [`e2etests/helpers.py`](e2etests/helpers.py) for the 150+ method test helper library.

**Prerequisites:**
- `cargo install tauri-driver` (WebDriver bridge for Tauri)
- `sudo apt install webkit2gtk-driver` (WebKitWebDriver)
- `sudo apt install xvfb` (headless display)
- Built daemon: `cargo build --release -p pomodoro-daemon`
- Built GUI: `cargo tauri build`

**Test isolation:** Each test file gets a fresh daemon (random port, temp DB), fresh GUI session, and its own Xvfb display. No cross-file contamination.

### Unit Test Coverage
- Auth: seed root, register, login, wrong password, unauthenticated rejection
- Tasks: CRUD, update fields, subtask cascade delete
- Comments: add, list, delete
- Time Reports: add with auto-assign
- Assignees: add, list, remove
- Admin: list users, non-root forbidden
- Rooms: full voting flow, join/leave/kick, role promotion, non-admin forbidden, close, delete, hours-mode accept, auto-advance
- Sprints: CRUD, filtering, task add/remove, detail, start/complete, board grouping, burndown snapshots, duplicate prevention, cascade delete
- Burn Log: log + cancel lifecycle, multi-user summary, cascade on sprint delete
- Task-Sprint mappings endpoint
- Timer state, config, history
